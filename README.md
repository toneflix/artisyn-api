# Artisyn.io Backend API

## Find Artisans Near You

Artisyn is a decentralised protocol built on Starknet that connects local artisans with users through community-curated listings. Our platform creates a trustless ecosystem where skilled workers can be discovered, verified, and compensated without relying on centralised intermediaries.
